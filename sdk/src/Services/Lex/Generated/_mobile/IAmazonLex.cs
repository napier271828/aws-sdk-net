    /// of operations (API). Your conversational bot uses the runtime API to understand user
    /// utterances (user input text or voice). For example, suppose a user says "I want pizza",
    /// your bot sends this input to Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes
    /// that the user request is for the OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in
    /// the bot). Then Amazon Lex engages in user conversation on behalf of the bot to elicit
    /// required information (slot values, such as pizza size and crust type), and then performs
    /// fulfillment activity (that you configured when you created the bot). You use the build-time
    /// API to create and manage your Amazon Lex bot. For a list of build-time operations,
    /// see the build-time API, .
